## NASA: Asteroids Classification

This project aims to apply supervised machine learning models and algorithms to classify Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) using pre-collected data, specifically to predict whether an asteroid is potentially hazardous. This is framed as a binary classification problem, where the goal is to determine if an asteroid poses a potential risk.

For further details, please refer to the presentation [here](Presentation.pdf)

### How to run the Project
The Project is a Jupyter Notebook, and utilizes some essential libraries required for the assignment. These libraries are fundamental for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.

Therefore, to run it we recommend using **Anaconda**, as it comes with most libraries already installed.
Additional libraries will be installed once the notebook is run.

Without anaconda the following must be installed:

> Python version should be higher than 3.10.14.
> If you don't have python you can download it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Libraries:
```
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install imbalanced-learn
pip install notebook
```
